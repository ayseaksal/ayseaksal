I have conducted exploration, blackbox, UAT and manual tests in 20 years of e - commerce web - mobile projects. I fixed it on the basis of customer acceptance criteria in writing test cases and correcting faulty writings. I have ensured that the errors are sent to the management side automatically by e-mail on a regular basis. By automating web pages using Selenium web driver, I ran the regression tests, and in case of an error during the run, I took the screen and video recording of the error, and forwarded the error to the developer and fixed it. Using Appium, I ran the mobile regression tests and assigned the mobile errors to the developer during the run. By subtracting the Code and Test coverage from 30% to 99%, I ensured that the quality and error-free product went live without any errors. By using continuous integration, continuous testing, and continuous delivery processes such as Azure DevOps and Jenkins together with devops teams, I ensured that the whole process was brought to life in a quality and automated manner. By using Agile culture and by holding daily - weekly regular meetings, I ensured that the test teams were managed and that the test culture was instilled in the companies.
